        What is Git
      </h3>
      <p>
        Git is a version control system. A version control system allows you to manage your projects and helps in tracking  changes and updates to your project files and repositories on GitHub and other repositories.
      </p>
      <p>
        There exist multiple version control systems such as Mercurial, Azure DevOps server, Aws codecommit, and SVN. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog we are going to delve into Git and GitHub.

    <h3>
      Initializing a Git repository
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To initialize a Git repository, open the foder where your project is located in the cmd and run this commmad; "git init"
    </p>

    <h3>
      Adding files to the staging area
    </h3>
    <p>
      The files in yor folder you inialized will appear as untracked files. To know files in your repository are tracked or untacked run this command:"git status"
    </p>
    <img src="git-stat.png" alt="Checking Git Status" />
    <p>
      To add a file to the staging area you need to run this command: "git add " . If you want to add all the files include a fullstop "." after add, or the name of file you want to add.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files that we staged are now tracked files and are included in our repository. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>
      Commiting changes
    </h3>
    <p>
    The files we have staged needs to have an explanation of what has happened. We add those  explanations using the commit command as follows: git commit -m "first files"
    <img src="git-com.png" alt="first files to commit">
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>
      Branches
    </h3>
    <p>
      Branches are separate versions of the main  repository that we can manipulate without affecting the original repository. 
      They enable us to collaborate with others in projects. They also allows us to work on separate work space.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Creating a Branch
    </h3>
    <p>
      To create a branch enter this command in cmd: "git branch [name of branch]"

    <h3>
      Viewing all branches
    </h3>
    <p>
      To view all branches in a repository, simply run this command: git branch -a . The active branch will be highlighted in green and an asterisk.
